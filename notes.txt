- generate training_data and training_labels:
 data - some list of data about something (?)
 labels - list of the thing you want to predict based on the data

- generate test_data and test_labels (see above)

- pad data to ensure equal lengths

- set up model for training (most confusing part)

- set aside some of the training_data for validation

- set up an early stop callback to optimize

- run training on model

- check results for accuracy by evaluating trained model against test data

- if model is doing ok, make some predictions based on input test data (here we could use a markov chain to generate something and use our model to predict if it's good or not)

- save the model for doing more testing in the future
